# Algorithm and DS Practice

## Codewars
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a community for practicing and improving technical skills. Community members create kata (coding problems) that members can practice on. Kata are problems formatted similar to production code, methods are testing using testing frameworks instead of print output. Available Kata have varying levels of difficulty, from 8kyu to 1kyu. More information can be found in the [codewars wiki](https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/About-Codewars).

### My Codewars
